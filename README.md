# TensorFlow Serving with Docker: A Practical Guide

## Overview

This project is designed to be a hands-on guide for learning how to deploy machine learning models using Docker and TensorFlow Serving. 

## Objectives

- **Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Implement and train a convolutional neural network using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a staple in machine learning for image classification tasks.
- **Save and Serve the Model**: Learn how to save trained model in TensorFlow's SavedModel format and serve it using TensorFlow Serving.
- **Utilize Docker for TensorFlow Serving**: Manage TensorFlow Serving environments using Docker, including how to stop, remove, and pull TensorFlow Serving containers.
- **Deploy and Query the Model**: Deploy your trained model for inference and write a script to query the model for predictions, focusing on measuring and analyzing latency.
